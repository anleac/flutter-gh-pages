# Flutter GH Pages

Automates the build and deployment of your Flutter web app on Github gh pages

# Action

To use this action, create an action like the following on your workflows folder

```yml
name: Gh-Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
      - uses: bluefireteam/flutter-gh-pages@v7
```
To build a project in a folder other that the root, use the `workingDir` property

```yml
      ...
      - uses: bluefireteam/flutter-gh-pages@v7
        with:
          workingDir: example
```

By default, the action will use the auto setting for web renderers, to change that you can use the `webRenderer` property.

More on web renderers here: https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/web-renderers

```yml
      ...
      - uses: bluefireteam/flutter-gh-pages@v7
        with:
          webRenderer: canvaskit
```

The possible values for webRenderer are:

- auto: Use the default Flutter setting, which is based on the device and browser capabilities.
- canvaskit: Use the CanvasKit renderer, which uses WebGL and WebAssembly to render graphics.
- html: Use the HTML renderer, which uses DOM elements and CSS to render graphics.
- both: Use both renderers and generate two versions of the web app, one in the root folder (here would be the CanvasKit version) and one in a subfolder specified by the htmlRoute property.

If you use both as the webRenderer value, you can also specify the name of the subfolder where the HTML version will be placed, using the htmlFolder property. The default value is htmlVersion.

If you've selected the `both` value for the webRenderer, the HTML variant will be deployed to the `htmlRoute` directory. By default, this is set to `htmlVersion`.

```yml
      ...
      - uses: bluefireteam/flutter-gh-pages@v7
        with:
          htmlRoute: another-route
```

By default, the action will send the files to the `gh-pages` branch, which is the default used by Github Pages.
If you need to change that, the `targetBranch` property can be used

```yml
      ...
      - uses: bluefireteam/flutter-gh-pages@v7
        with:
          targetBranch: my-gh-pages-branch
```

By default, the generated page only works on `User or Organization sites` ex:`user.github.io/`. 
You can change that by specifying the `baseHref` argument, so the site will work on a `Project Site`, ex:`user.github.io/repoName`.

The parameter `baseHref` must start and end with a forward slash `"/"`.
(For projects created on flutter version earlier than `2.5.0`, please manually edit the file `web/index.html`, changing the line `<base href="/">` to `<base href="$FLUTTER_BASE_HREF">`)

```yml
      ...
      - uses: bluefireteam/flutter-gh-pages@v7
        with:
          baseHref: /my-repo/
```

To pass arguments to the builder with `--dart-define` the `customArgs` property can be used

```yml
      ...
      - uses: bluefireteam/flutter-gh-pages@v7
        with:
          customArgs: --dart-define="simple=example"
```


And consumed in the code via (**const** is mandatory!):
```dart
void main() async {
  String arg = const String.fromEnvironment('simple'); // arg = "example"
  ...
}
```


To use github pages with a custom domain, add a file named `CNAME` to the
`<project>/web` folder whose contents is your domain, like:
> subdomain.domain.com
